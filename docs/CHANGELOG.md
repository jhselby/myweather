## v0.5.42 • May 3, 2026
* Fixed 13 broken HTML attributes where `class` was inside `style` — elements now get proper theme-aware colors in light mode

* Renamed "Swim Float" card to "Beach Day"
* Redesigned wind compass arrow — full-length through center with gap for speed number, extends past circle, bolder styling
* Removed dead code: `toggleSettings()`, `toggleMenu()`, `toggleMenuSection()`, duplicate `updateForecastSelection()` call, test comment

## v0.5.41 • 2026-05-02
* **Meteorological Audit — 7 fixes across precipitation, forecast, and resilience**
  * Surface precip type (wet bulb) now used everywhere instead of 850mb column type
  * 850mb override catches all frozen/mixed types when surface temp > 40°F
  * Fixed precip_surface.py dead code — never returned "rain"
  * Fixed HRRR/GFS handoff dropping Monday from 7-day forecast
  * Days 8-10 forecasts now use temp-based precip type
  * 7-day GFS data now gets wet bulb and surface precip processing
* **Processor Improvements**
  * Sea breeze uses corrected hyperlocal temp for land/water differential
  * Added advection fog detection (warm moist air over cold water) — primary coastal fog type
  * fog.py now returns fog_type (radiation vs advection)
* **GFS Failure Resilience**
  * Hyperlocal temp correction works when GFS model temp unavailable (uses WU station weighted average)
  * Briefing AI falls back to cache when current temp missing/zero (prevents 0°F briefings)
* **Frontend**
  * Active weather alert shows both surface and column precip types
  * App returns to briefing tab after 5+ minutes away; always opens on briefing
